### Ingredients:
- [ ] 8 corn tortillas, cut into triangles  
- [ ] 2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
- [ ] 2 cups green salsa (store-bought or homemade)  
- [ ] 4 large eggs  
- [ ] ½ cup Mexican crema or sour cream  
- [ ] ½ cup queso fresco or cotija cheese, crumbled  
- [ ] ¼ small red onion, thinly sliced  
- [ ] 1 avocado, sliced  
- [ ] 2 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped  
- [ ] Salt to taste  

### Steps for preparation:

1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat and fry the tortilla triangles in batches until lightly golden and crisp, then transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels.
2. Pour the green salsa into the same skillet, bring it to a gentle simmer, and cook for 3–5 minutes until slightly thickened.
3. Add the fried tortilla chips to the skillet and gently fold them into the salsa until evenly coated but still retaining some texture.
4. In a separate pan, cook the eggs to your preference (fried or scrambled).
5. Transfer the sauced tortillas to serving plates and top with eggs, crema, crumbled cheese, red onion, avocado slices, and chopped cilantro. Serve immediately.

### Notes:

For softer chilaquiles, allow the tortillas to simmer longer in the salsa.  
For added protein, include shredded chicken or black beans.  
Red salsa can be substituted for green salsa if preferred.
