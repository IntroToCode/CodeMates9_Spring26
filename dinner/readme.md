### Steps for preparation:

1. Prepare the vegetables. Peel and finely chop 1/2 medium yellow onion. Peel 1 medium carrot. Cut the carrot and 1 celery stalk into 1/4-inch dice. Measure out 2 cups canned whole tomatoes and their juices, and coarsely chop the tomatoes.
2. Cook the vegetables. Put the onion, carrot, celery, 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, and 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil in a large, heavy bottomed saucepan and place over medium-high heat. Sauté, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables have lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
3. Add the beef, wine, and milk. Add 12 ounces ground beef and break it up with a wooden spoon. Cook until the beef is cooked through and no longer pink. Add 1/2 cup dry white wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost half the liquid has evaporated. Add 1/2 cup whole milk and 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg and cook, stirring occasionally, until half the milk has evaporated.
4. Add the tomatoes. Add the tomatoes and their juices, and 1 1/4 teaspoons fine salt. Once the tomatoes have started bubbling, turn the heat down very low so that the sauce is barely simmering. Cook uncovered, stirring every 15 to 20 minutes, for 3 1/2 hours. (This is a good time to make the pasta.) If all the liquid evaporates before the cooking time is up, add water in 1/2-cup increments as needed. Make sure all the liquid has evaporated before removing the sauce from the heat.

# Bechamel Sauce
1. Heat the milk and make the roux. Place 2 cups whole milk in a small saucepan over medium heat and heat until steam is released when the milk is stirred. Meanwhile, melt 4 tablespoons unsalted butter in a 2-quart saucepan over medium-low heat. Add 1/4 cup all-purpose flour and whisk until the mixture is smooth. Cook, whisking constantly, for about 1 minute, then remove from the heat. Do not let the flour brown.
2. Add the warmed milk to the roux. When the milk is hot, transfer it to a heatproof measuring cup or pitcher with a spout. Return the flour mixture to medium heat and begin adding the hot milk, very slowly at first, mixing with the whisk. Do not be concerned if the mixture becomes quite thick at first. Continue adding the milk slowly while mixing with the whisk. As the consistency becomes thinner, you can add the milk more rapidly until all of it has been mixed in.
3. Add the salt and cook until thickened. Add 1/2 teaspoon fine salt and cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the sauce begins to thicken, 10 to 15 minutes. The sauce is done when it coats the whisk thickly.

# Assemble
1. Heat the oven. Preheat the oven to 425°F.
2. Coat the bottom of the baking dish and make the filling. Spread a thin coating of béchamel on the bottom of an 8 x 11 1/2-inch rectangular baking dish. Mix the remaining béchamel with the bolognese sauce and 1/2 cup of the Parmigiano-Reggiano to make the filling.
3. Add a layer of pasta. Use the bottom of the baking dish to determine the length of pasta needed to cover it completely and cut a piece of pasta that you’ll use as a template for all the layers. Place a sheet of pasta on the bottom of the pan, filling in with smaller strips any area that the sheet does not cover.
4. Assemble the lasagne. Spread a thin coating of the filling over the pasta sheet, then cover with another sheet of pasta. Continue until you have 7 or more layers of pasta and filling, saving a little filling to cover the top layer. Cover the top layer of pasta with the remaining filling.
5. Sprinkle with cheese and dot with butter. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano over the top and dot with 1 tablespoon unsalted butter broken up into a few pieces.
6. Bake the lasagne. Bake until the top has lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Take the lasagne out of the oven and let it rest for 5 minutes before serving.
